AI-Generated Circuit Board Layout
🚀 An AI model that predicts optimal circuit board layouts using PyTorch, deployed via Flask and Streamlit.

📌 Project Overview
This project uses deep learning to generate an optimized 2D layout for circuit board components based on predefined constraints such as board size and component count. The AI model is trained on a synthetic dataset and predicts efficient placements.

🔹 Features
✔️ AI-powered component placement optimization
✔️ Streamlit UI for interactive layout visualization
✔️ Flask API for real-time predictions
✔️ Ngrok support for public API deployment
✔️ Matplotlib visualization of the layout

🛠️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/AI-Generated-Circuit-Board-Layout.git
cd AI-Generated-Circuit-Board-Layout
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Train the Model
bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
Note: The model is trained on a synthetic dataset. You can modify it for real-world data.

4️⃣ Run the Flask API
bash
Copy
Edit
python flask_app.py
This will start a REST API for predictions.

5️⃣ Deploy the Streamlit App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
This launches an interactive UI to visualize circuit layouts.

🚀 How It Works?
1️⃣ AI Model
A PyTorch-based neural network predicts the best layout based on given inputs.
Trained on synthetic datasets of circuit board components.
2️⃣ Streamlit UI
Users can select board size and component count.
The AI-generated layout is displayed using Matplotlib.
3️⃣ Flask API
Accepts input JSON data and returns optimized component placements.
Deployable using Ngrok for public access.
